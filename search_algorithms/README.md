# Search Algorithms and space complexity

## Purpose of this repository

This repo was designed to study and implement some basics of searching algorithms:

- Sequential Search: In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example: <u>Linear Search</u>
- Interval Search: These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are more efficient than Linear Search method, as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in 2 half. For Example: <u>Binary Search.</u>
