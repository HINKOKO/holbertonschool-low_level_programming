# C- Bit Manipulation

**Objectives**

Learn how to use Bitwise operators, which are in C (and Java):

& - bitwise AND
| - bitwise OR 
^ - bitwise XOR 
~ - bitwise NOT,an unary operator, which "flips" the bit, 0 becomes 1 and vice versa
<< - left shift operator
>> - right shift operator

How to manipulate bits:

Bit manipulation is the process of applying logical operations on a sequence of bits 
to achieve a result. It is an act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data that are shorter than a word.
 **Computer tasks that requires bit manipulation**
 -Low level device control
 -Error detection and correction algorithms
 -Data compression
 -Encryption algorithm 
 -Optimization

Bit manipulation can obviate or reduce the need to loop over a data structure and can speed up 
coding as bit manipulation are processed in paralell.
